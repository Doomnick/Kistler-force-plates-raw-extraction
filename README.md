# Kistler-force-plates-raw-extraction
This script processes raw data from Kistler force plates and generates an Excel report (.xlsx) containing calculated values. It extracts relevant data, performs necessary calculations, and organizes the results into a structured report, making it easy to analyze and interpret force plate measurements.

 It automatically detects jumps from the signal curve and prompts the user via console to confirm the accuracy of the jump detection.
